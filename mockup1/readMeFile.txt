PDF upload is validated to be a pdf only.
Image preview as well as pdf preview are made for users satisfaction.
Upon scrolling down in the home page or if width is minimized a secondary menu replaces the navigation on the top left hand side.
Since backend is not inserted into the project, sign in and sign up pages simply href to the profile page, where the edit profile info doesn't effect any changes.
Angularjs 2 is used for Profile page, depending on the state of the page given by two way binding.
Angularjs 2 is also used in search resumes for its decorative directives.

Future plans upon creating back end:
- Move Css and js files in an assets folder, for easier project navigation.
- Create additional filters for resumes that work with backend.
- Implement an algorithm that is used to prompting the most useful resumes near the top of the page
- Profile edit info screen doesn't have any validations, needs find a standard on needed fields, or just copy the validations made on the sign up page.
